A simple JavaScript-based quiz game

Modular quiz game. Questions can be added in object format in the questions.js file. Currently it has six real tough questions about JavaScript.

The high score table is dynamically generated in the script based on local storage, and is saved to local storage if you get a high score. It has some default values.

It has some pizzaz in that the timer is animated to bounce on seconds elapsing and gets all big and stuff when there is five or less seconds on the clock.

Score is decided by time left * multiplier + base value. These variables are all at the top after a large set of consts.

I threw a start button dialog in last-minute for now. I might make it nicer later.

## Wow, that's super cool. How do I play?
